# PHPBaseProxy
PHPBaseProxy Is the trying to implement Proxy server on shared PHP web hosting

# why
The reason I'm doing this is to simplify and redice the cost of creating Proxy servers. 
There are lots of free proxies out there which I owe them my knowledge (I weren't able to open sites like php.net or AndroidStudio or oven be able to download Chrome (Cry)  )

So to help children like me to have access to free Internet Contribute and deploy free proxies. <3


# How To Use
Put the code in your hosting (Issue notice [1])
Edit bellow lines to match your needs:
Line 3: $domain='localhost'; 
Line 13: $logHeaders = FALSE;
