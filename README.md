# PHPBaseProxy
PHPBaseProxy Is the trying to implement Proxy server on shared PHP web hosting

The reason I'm doing this is to simplify and redice the cost of creating Proxy servers. 
There are lots of free proxies out there which I owe them my knowledge (I weren't able to open sites like php.net or AndroidStudio or oven be able to download Chrome (Cry)  )

So to help children like me to have access to free Internet Contribute and deploy free proxies. <3
